                About me and <br> what I can do for you</h2>
            <p>I'm a student of software engineering with
            primary interests in machine learning, distributed systems, and
            brain-machine interfacing. My passions for creating useful solutions
            from code and contributing to a world where everyone's needs can be
            meet have lead me here. In addition to my professional interests, I
            also love hiking, sailing, theatre, dogs, basketball, listening to
            and making music, math, science (especially physics), video gaming,
            and philosophizing.<br><br>
            Take a look at my portfolio to see some
            examples of both my previous work and the side projects I've
            enjoyed. For clients with simpler web development needs, I offer
            several <a href="#spacer2">fixed-price packages</a>. These are most
            apt for those of you who require construction of a content-based
            or a standard e-commerce site. Clients that have more specific
            development needs or custom web solutions are recommended to
            complete the client <a href="#spacer3"> questionnaire</a>. The
            questionnaire is an informal starting point for our
            client-contractor relationship. It helps me to both understand your
            needs and improve my services, as well as provide you with the
            means to communicate to me your initial plans/concerns for your
            project. A custom price quote estimate will be generated using the
            information gathered from the questionnaire, but more accurate
            pricing can only be determined after discussing your project
            with you personally.</p>
